# Introduction to Create React App
## Available Command Scripts
Within the project directory, you have access to execute the following command scripts:

npm start
This command initiates the application in development mode.
Access http://localhost:3000 to preview the application in your browser.

The page will automatically refresh upon implementing changes.
Any potential code style issues will be displayed in the console.

npm test
By running this command, you activate the test runner in an interactive watch mode.
Refer to the section on running tests for comprehensive details.

npm run build
Using this command compiles the application for production, generating the optimized output within the build folder.
This process involves bundling React in production mode and optimizing build performance for optimal results.

The build is compressed, and filenames are altered with unique hashes for identification.
The application is now primed for deployment.

For further information on deployment, consult the deployment section.

npm run eject
### Note: This action is irreversible. After eject, there's no turning back.

In case you're unsatisfied with the existing build tools and configurations, you can perform an 'eject' operation at any point. This action eliminates the singular build dependency in your project.

Consequently, all configuration files and related dependencies (such as webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) are duplicated into your project, granting you full control over them. All commands except eject will still be functional, but they will refer to the copied scripts, allowing for customization. At this juncture, you're in complete control.

It's important to note that eject should be used cautiously. The predefined feature set is suited for small and moderate deployments. It's not obligatory to utilize this feature, but it's available for customization when you're ready.
