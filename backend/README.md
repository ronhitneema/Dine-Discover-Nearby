# Application Structure and Components for Request Handling

In our application architecture, we adopt a structured approach to manage the handling of incoming requests and responses. This approach ensures better organization, modularity, and separation of concerns. Our key components include Routes, Controllers, Middleware, Configurations, and Models. This setup is optimized for efficient handling of asynchronous operations using async/await, particularly in conjunction with MongoDB.

## Routes: Guiding Requests

**Routes** serve as the initial entry points for incoming requests. They function as a mapping between URLs and specific actions. To maintain a clean and organized structure, each distinct functionality within our application has its dedicated route file. For instance, the `menuRoutes.js` file is responsible for handling menu-related requests.

## Controllers: Orchestrating Interactions

**Controllers** play a pivotal role in orchestrating interactions between various components. Instead of embedding request functions directly within route files, we centralize these functions within controller files. This separation enhances modularity and maintainability. In the context of the `menuController.js`, the controller oversees the execution of actions corresponding to various HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

## Middleware: Handling Requests and Errors

**Middleware** functions come into play when dealing with request handling and error management. These functions intervene between the initial request and the final response, allowing us to perform tasks such as request preprocessing, error handling, and authentication.

## Configuration: Managing Resources

**Configuration files** encompass settings that tailor the application to its environment. This includes database configurations (e.g., for MongoDB) and other global settings. By isolating these configurations, we ensure adaptability across diverse deployment scenarios.

## Models: Structuring Data

**Models** define the structure of data in our MongoDB database. They serve as a bridge connecting the application and the database, providing an organized representation of the data. Each model corresponds to a table in the database and is used to interact with the data in a more structured manner.

## Async Handler and MongoDB

We leverage JavaScript's `async/await` paradigm to manage asynchronous operations effectively, particularly when working with MongoDB. This approach enhances code readability and mitigates callback complexity by allowing us to write asynchronous code in a more synchronous style.

## Security Measures: Bcrypt and JWT

To ensure robust security, we implement **Bcrypt.js** for password hashing and use **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for authentication. JWT tokens are signed using unique user IDs, enhancing data security during transmission.

In summary, our application adheres to a well-defined structure where incoming requests are directed through routes, managed by controllers, and facilitated by middleware. This organization promotes maintainability, scalability, and code reusability. Our use of async/await and secure practices further elevates the quality of our application.
